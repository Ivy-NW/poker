    question: "What is the Royalty Music Platform?",
    answer: "It's a decentralized platform allowing artists to tokenize their music royalty rights as NFTs. Fans and investors can purchase these NFTs to earn a share of the royalties generated by the music, primarily through streaming."
  },
  {
    question: "How are artists rated?",
    answer: "Artists are dynamically rated on a scale of 2.5â€“5.0 based on various performance metrics like streaming data, fan engagement, and market trends. This rating, along with a risk metric, helps investors make informed decisions."
  },
  {
    question: "What are Fractional Royalty Rights?",
    answer: "We use ERC-1155 Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) to represent fractional ownership of music rights. This means you can own a small piece of a song's royalty stream, making it accessible to a wider range of investors."
  },
  {
    question: "How are royalties distributed?",
    answer: "Smart contracts on the Avalanche C-Chain handle royalty distributions automatically. When royalties are collected (simulated or from real streams), they are distributed proportionally to NFT holders who have staked their tokens."
  },
  {
    question: "What is staking in this context?",
    answer: "By 'staking' your royalty NFTs, you actively participate in earning. Staked NFTs are eligible for royalty payouts. The more shares you stake, the larger your portion of the distributed royalties."
  },
  {
    question: "What technology is used?",
    answer: "The frontend is built with Next.js, React, and Tailwind CSS. Smart contracts are written in Solidity and deployed on the Avalanche C-Chain. We use Web3.js/Ethers.js for blockchain interactions and plan to integrate with Core Wallet SDK."
  },
  {
    question: "Is this platform secure?",
    answer: "Security is a top priority. Smart contracts will undergo audits. We plan to use multi-signature wallets for critical operations and integrate with oracles for reliable real-world data feeds. KYC/AML procedures are also part of our long-term compliance strategy."

                <p className="text-gray-300">Artists connect their wallets, define their royalty-sharing NFTs (ERC-1155), and set investment targets. Each NFT represents a fraction of future royalty rights for specific musical works.</p>
