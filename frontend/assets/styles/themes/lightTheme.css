/* This file can be used if you prefer to separate theme variables into different files.
   However, the current setup in global.css uses CSS variables and a data-theme attribute,
   which is a common and effective way to handle theming.

   If you were to use this file, you'd typically define the light theme variables here
   and import this file conditionally or use a CSS preprocessor to switch themes.

   Example content if this file were actively used to override variables:
*/

/*
:root {
  --background-primary: #F5F5F5;
  --background-secondary: #ffffff;
  --text-primary: #333333;
  --text-secondary: #555555;
  --border-color: #dddddd;
  --card-bg: #ffffff;
  --card-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);

  --accent-blue: #4A90E2;
  --highlight-gold: #FFD700;
  --error-red: #FF6B6B;
  --success-green: #2ECC71;
  --button-text: #FFFFFF; / Text on blue button /
}
*/

/* Since global.css already handles theming with [data-theme="light"],
   this file can remain empty or be used for more specific light theme overrides
   that are not easily covered by just variable changes. */

/* For example, if certain components need structurally different styles in light mode: */
/*
body[data-theme="light"] .some-specific-component {
    border: 1px solid var(--accent-blue);
}
*/

/* As of now, this file is not strictly necessary due to the theming approach in global.css */
/* It's included to match the requested file structure. */
