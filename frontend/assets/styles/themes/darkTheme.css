/* This file can be used if you prefer to separate theme variables into different files.
   The current setup in global.css uses CSS variables and a data-theme attribute,
   which is a common and effective way to handle theming. The dark theme is default there.

   If you were to use this file to define the dark theme (perhaps if light was default),
   you'd typically define the dark theme variables here.

   Example content if this file were actively used to define the dark theme:
*/

/*
:root {
  --background-primary: #1E1E1E;
  --background-secondary: #2a2a2a;
  --text-primary: #FFFFFF;
  --text-secondary: #a0a0a0;
  --border-color: #444444;
  --card-bg: #2c3e50;
  --card-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2);

  --accent-blue: #4A90E2;
  --highlight-gold: #FFD700;
  --error-red: #FF6B6B;
  --success-green: #2ECC71;
  --button-text: #FFFFFF;
}
*/

/* Since global.css already handles theming with :root (defaulting to dark)
   and provides a [data-theme="light"] selector for the light theme,
   this file can remain empty or be used for more specific dark theme overrides
   that are not easily covered by just variable changes in :root. */

/* For example, if certain components need structurally different styles specifically in dark mode: */
/*
body[data-theme="dark"] .some-specific-component-dark-override,
:root .some-specific-component-dark-override {
    border: 1px solid var(--highlight-gold);
}
*/

/* As of now, this file is not strictly necessary due to the theming approach in global.css
   where dark theme is the default. It's included to match the requested file structure. */
